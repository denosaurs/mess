Mess is a modern, broker-agnostic message queue for use in a distributed
environment. Currently, AMQP is supported, with plans to add support for other
platforms such as Redis and MQTT in the future.

## Example

This example demonstrates how to use the AMQP message queue with the json
serializer and deserializer:

```ts
import { AMQPMessageQueue } from "https://deno.land/x/mess/message_queue/implementations/amqp/mod.ts";
import * as json from "https://deno.land/x/mess/serializer_deserializer/json.ts";

const queue = new AMQPMessageQueue("test", {
  serializerDeserializer: deno,
  connection: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672",
});

for await (const event of queue) {
  console.log(event.data);
  await event.deferred.resolve();
}
```
